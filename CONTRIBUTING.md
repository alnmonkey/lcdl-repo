## How to contribute to LC-DL
Contributing to the LC-DL shortcut itself is unfortunately, not an option. Due to the *confusing* nature of iOS Shortcuts and the fact that they technically aren't actually code, I will be sole developer of the shortcut.

**However**, I will always accept app submissions *and* requests. Please only submit an app if **you currently have it installed within LiveContainer**. Anyone can request apps, wether you have it installed or not.

### App Submissions
An app *submission* is when you send me the file of an app you want uploaded to The LC-DL App Repository.

To submit an app to be added to The LC-DL App Repository, please message me on Discord (@sinceohsix), make your message clear, name the app you are submitting, and if possible, send me a download link to either the zipped .app file, or the .app itself, otherwise I can guide you through fetching and compressing your LiveContainer apps. 

.app files are preferred over .ipa, if you have an .ipa file, please use the request form and upload the file there instead.

### App Requests
An app *request* is when you tell me the name of an app, and when the time comes, I'll try to add it to the repository.

If you want to request an app, please fill out [this](https://forms.gle/KCDFcWtzJNs9W3n7A) form with the apps name as well as a link to it.
