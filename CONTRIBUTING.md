## How to contribute to LC-DL
Contributing to the LC-DL shortcut itself is unfortunately, not an option. Due to the *confusing* nature of iOS Shortcuts and the fact that they technically aren't actually code, I will remain the sole developer of the shortcut.

**However**, I will always accept app submissions *and* requests. Please only submit an app if **you currently have it installed within LiveContainer**. Anyone can request apps, wether you have it installed or not.

For more information about contributing apps, please see [this page](https://github.com/lc-dl/apps/tree/main?tab=contributing-ov-file).
