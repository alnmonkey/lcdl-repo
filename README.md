LC-DL is an iOS shortcut to easily download apps to LiveContainer. The shortcut works by directly adding the .app file to your LiveContainers `Applications` folder. Apps can also come with tweak and/or data folders and will have necessary LiveContainer settings pre-configured. This allows you to install apps without any setup required! You can also download apps from repositories that are made specifically for LiveContainer!

### Setup:  

>[!Note]
LC-DL is an iOS Shortcut, meaning the Shortcuts app needs to be installed. It comes with your iPhone but if you deleted it, download it again from [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id1462947752).

To install LC-DL either:
1. Go to the [releases](https://github.com/sinceohsix/lcdl-repo/releases/latest) page.
2. Download the latest `LC-DL.shortcut` file.
3. Open `LC-DL.shortcut` in the shortcuts app.
4. Set the shortcut up by selecting the `On My iDevice > LiveContainer` folder.
5. Turn the "Allow Sharing Large Amounts of Data" setting on in the settings of the shortcut app, found within the regular iOS settings.

or... You can get it from [this](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/c17b6696014d4107835a67febd9202d4) iCloud Link. Please make sure you still follow the setup directions.

### Usage:
**Codes:**  
LC-DL is powered by 6-character codes. These codes can be linked to either repositories or individual apps. You can enter them by tapping "‚ûï Enter Code" after running LC-DL.

**Buttons:**  
There are also LC-DL buttons that will automatically fetch the app or repository for the code they link to. They look like this <img src="assets/install.png" width="50"> and this <img src="assets/repo.png" width="50">. Depending on what the button is for, either an app or repository, tapping the button will prompt to download the app or add the repository!

**Repositories:**  
You can add a repository with a 6-character code or by tapping this <img src="assets/repo.png" width="50"> button where you see it. You can view saved repositories on LC-DL by running the shortcut and selecting "üåê View Repositories". After selecting a repository, you can choose an app to download from it.

**LC2HS Integration:**  
[LC2HS](https://github.com/lc-dl/lc2hs) is another shortcut I've made that allows you to easily add your LiveContainer apps to your home screen. If you have both LC-DL and LC2HS setup, you will be asked if you want to add your newly installed app to your homescreen automatically!

The LC-DL App Repository has over 40 apps and games and there is *at least* one app for everyone! There are even ways for *you* to contribute to the repository!
