# LC-DL Repo
This is the main repo for LC-DL (LiveContainer Downloader), a shortcut that easily allows you to install and setup LiveContainer apps.

### What is LC-DL:
LC-DL is a shortcut to easily add apps to your LiveContainer. The shortcut works by directly adding the .app files to your LiveContainer folder. If an app comes with tweaks, data folders, or specific settings that need to be turned on, they will be setup automatically as well. This allows people to easily share apps for installation with LiveContainer with the least amount of setup required.
